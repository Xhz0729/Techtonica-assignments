# üêæ Animal Sighting Tracker

This **Animal Sighting Tracker** is a full-stack web application that allows users to track sightings of endangered animal species. Users can view individual animal details, add new sightings, and search for sightings within a certain date range. The application uses the **PERN stack** (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js) to handle both the frontend and backend, with data stored in a PostgreSQL database.

## üåø Project Features

- **Record sightings**: Users can add sighting record when and where individual animals were sighted.
- **View detailed information**: The app shows detailed information for each individual animal, including first and recent sightings, sighting count, and species data.
- **Search for sightings**: Users can search for animal sightings within a given date range.

## üöÄ Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Styling**: Custom CSS for a clean and modern UI
